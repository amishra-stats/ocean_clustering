# ocean_clustering
Datasets, algorithms, and code to develop clustering methods for the global ocean

This project aim to create a internally consistent dataset observed and modelled ocean properties to be used when developing and testing geophysical clustering approaches. We will provide both data and code to perform the analysis. The dataset consists of monthly climologies resampled to the same 1/2Â° grid.
