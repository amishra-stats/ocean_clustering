# TryJackson

This folder contains code that will download the half degree data grids for DARWIN and GEO and attempt to apply the OC-CCI water class algorithm to it.

The important code is JacksonModelRemote.jl. In the current version, the Rirr to Rrs correction is applied to the DARWIN dataset still.
